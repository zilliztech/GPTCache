    "# Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to use LangChain for question answering over a list of documents. It covers four different types of chains: `stuff`, `map_reduce`, `refine`, `map_rerank`. And You can find the origin notebook in [LangChain example](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/docs/modules/chains/index_examples/question_answering.ipynb), and this example will show you how to set the LLM with GPTCache so that you can cache the data with LLM. You can also try this example on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C3VBKn3L38opEyaOH-SlGQrANzHkR_5f?usp=sharing)."

    "Before running the example, make sure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set by executing `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`. If it is not already set, it can be set by using `export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` on Unix/Linux/MacOS systems or `set OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` on Windows systems.
