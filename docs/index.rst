What is GPTCache?
--------------------

ChatGPT and various large language models (LLMs) boast incredible versatility, enabling the development of a wide range of applications. However, as your application grows in popularity and encounters higher traffic levels, the expenses related to LLM API calls can become substantial. Additionally, LLM services might exhibit slow response times, especially when dealing with a significant number of requests.

To tackle this challenge, we have created GPTCache, a project dedicated to building a semantic cache for storing LLM responses. This library offers the following primary benefits:

1. **Decreased expenses**: Most LLM services charge fees based on a combination of number of requests and `token count <https://openai.com/pricing>`_. By caching query results, GPTCache reduces both the number of requests and the number of tokens sent to the LLM service. This minimizes the overall cost of using the service. 
2. **Enhanced performance**: LLMs employ generative AI algorithms to generate responses in real-time, a process that can sometimes be time-consuming. However, when a similar query is cached, the response time significantly improves, as the result is fetched directly from the cache, eliminating the need to interact with the LLM service. In most situations, GPTCache can also provide superior query throughput compared to standard LLM services.
3. **Improved scalability and availability**: LLM services frequently enforce `rate limits <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits>`_, which are constraints that APIs place on the number of times a user or client can access the server within a given timeframe. Hitting a rate limit means that additional requests will be blocked until a certain period has elapsed, leading to a service outage. With GPTCache, you can easily scale to accommodate an increasing volume of of queries, ensuring consistent performance as your application's user base expands.
4. **Flexible development environment**: When developing LLM applications, an LLM APIs connection is required to prove concepts. GPTCache offers the same interface as LLM APIs and can store LLM-generated or mocked data. This helps to verify your application's features without connecting to the LLM APIs or even the network.

How does it work?
--------------------

A good analogy for GptCache is to think of it as a more semantic version of Redis. In GPTCache, hits are not limited to exact matches, but rather also include prompts and context similar to previous queries. We believe that the traditional cache design still works for AIGC applications due to the following reasons:

- Locality is present everywhere. Like traditional application systems, AIGC applications also face similar hot topics. For instance, ChatGPT itself may be a popular topic among programmers.
- For purpose-built SaaS services, users tend to ask questions within a specific domain, with both temporal and spatial locality.
- By utilizing vector similarity search, it is possible to find a similarity relationship between questions and answers at a relatively low cost.

We provide `benchmarks <https://github.com/zilliztech/gpt-cache/blob/main/examples/benchmark/benchmark_sqlite_faiss_onnx.py>`_ to illustrate the concept. In semantic caching, there are three key measurement dimensions: false positives, false negatives, and hit latency. With the plugin-style implementation, users can easily tradeoff these three measurements according to their needs.


Getting Started
--------------------

**Note**:

- You can quickly try GPTCache and put it into a production environment without heavy development. However, please note that the repository is still under heavy development.
- By default, only a limited number of libraries are installed to support the basic cache functionalities. When you need to use additional features, the related libraries will be **automatically installed**.
- Make sure that the Python version is **3.8.1 or higher**, check: ``python --version``
- If you encounter issues installing a library due to a low pip version, run: ``python -m pip install --upgrade pip``.

dev install
````````````
::
 

    # clone GPTCache repo
    git clone https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache.git
    cd GPTCache

    # install the repo
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install


example usage
``````````````

These examples will help you understand how to use exact and similar matching with caching. 

Before running the example, **make sure** the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set by executing ``echo $OPENAI_API_KEY``. 

If it is not already set, it can be set by using ``export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`` on Unix/Linux/MacOS systems or `set OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` on Windows systems. 

> It is important to note that this method is only effective temporarily, so if you want a permanent effect, you'll need to modify the environment variable configuration file. For instance, on a Mac, you can modify the file located at ``/etc/profile``.

To use GPTCache exclusively, only the following lines of code are required, and there is no need to modify any existing code.

::

    from gptcache import cache
    from gptcache.adapter import openai

    cache.init()
    cache.set_openai_key()

Usage
-----

GPTCache is easy to understand and can boost your LLM API speed by 100x in just two steps:

1. Build your cache, which includes deciding on embedding functions, similarity evaluation functions, where to store the data, and eviction configurations.
2. Choose your adapter. GPTCache currently supports the OpenAI chatGPT interface and langchain interface. Langchain supports a variety of LLMs, such as Anthropic, Llama-cpp, Huggingface hub, and Cohere.

**Note**:
Not all combinations of different modules may be compatible with each other. For instance, if we disable the **Embedding Extractor**, the **Vector Store** may not function as intended. We are currently working on implementing a combination sanity check for **GPTCache**.
