# Cache Storage

**Cache Storage** is where the response from LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is stored. Cached responses are retrieved to assist in evaluating similarity and are returned to the requester if there is a good semantic match. At present, GPTCache supports SQLite and offers a universally accessible interface for extension of this module.
