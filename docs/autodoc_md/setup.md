# setup

[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/zilliztech/gptcache/setup.py)

This code is a setup script for the gptcache library, which is a caching library designed to speed up and reduce the cost of chat applications that rely on the LLM service. The library works as a memcache for AIGC applications, similar to how Redis works for traditional applications.

The script imports the `setuptools` library and the `find_packages` function from `setuptools`. It also imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. The `parse_requirements` function is defined to read the requirements from a file and return them as a list of strings.

The `setuptools.setup` function is then called to configure the library. The `name` parameter specifies the name of the library, `packages` specifies the packages to include in the distribution, `version` specifies the version number of the library, `author` and `author_email` specify the author and author email, `description` provides a brief description of the library, `long_description` provides a more detailed description of the library, `long_description_content_type` specifies the format of the long description, `install_requires` specifies the required dependencies for the library, `url` specifies the URL of the library's homepage, `license` specifies the license under which the library is distributed, and `python_requires` specifies the minimum version of Python required to use the library.

This script is used to package and distribute the gptcache library, making it easy for users to install and use the library in their own projects. For example, a user can install the library using pip:

```
pip install gptcache
```

Once installed, the user can import the library and use its caching functionality in their own chat application:

```
import gptcache

cache = gptcache.Cache()

# Store a value in the cache
cache.set('key', 'value')

# Retrieve a value from the cache
value = cache.get('key')
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to set up the package information for gptcache, including its name, version, author, description, dependencies, and more.

2. What is the significance of the parse_requirements function?
- The parse_requirements function is used to read in a file containing a list of dependencies and return a cleaned-up list of those dependencies, excluding any comments or blank lines.

3. What is the minimum version of Python required for this package?
- The minimum version of Python required for this package is 3.8.8, as specified by the `python_requires` parameter in the `setuptools.setup` function.
