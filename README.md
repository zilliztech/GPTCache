## ðŸ¤  What is GPT Cache?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a promising and transformative technology that has rapidly advanced in recent years. These models are capable of generating natural language text and have numerous applications, including chatbots, language translation, and creative writing. However, as the size of these models increases, so do the costs and performance requirements needed to utilize them effectively. This has led to significant challenges in developing on top of large models such as ChatGPT.

To address this issue, we have developed GPT Cache, a project that focuses on caching responses from language models, also known as a semantic cache. The system offers two major benefits:

1. Quick response to user requests: the caching system provides faster response times compared to large model inference, resulting in lower latency and faster response to user requests.
2. Reduced service costs: most LLM services are currently charged based on the number of tokens. If user requests hit the cache, it can reduce the number of requests and lower service costs.

## ðŸ¤” Why would GPT Cache be helpful?

A good analogy for GptCache is to think of it as a more semantic version of Redis. In GptCache, hits are not limited to exact matches, but rather also include prompts and context similar to previous queries. We believe that the traditional cache design still works for AIGC applications for the following reasons:

- Locality is present everywhere. Like traditional application systems, AIGC applications also face similar hot topics. For instance, ChatGPT itself may be a popular topic among programmers.
- For purpose-built SaaS services, users tend to ask questions within a specific domain, with both temporal and spatial locality.
- By utilizing vector similarity search, it is possible to find a similarity relationship between questions and answers at a relatively low cost.

We provide [benchmarks](https://github.com/zilliztech/gpt-cache/blob/main/examples/benchmark/benchmark_sqlite_faiss_onnx.py) to illustrate the concept. In semantic caching, there are three key measurement dimensions: false positives, false negatives, and hit latency. With the plugin-style implementation, users can easily tradeoff these three measurements according to their needs.

## ðŸ˜Š Quick Start

**Note**:

- You can quickly try GPT cache and put it into a production environment without heavy development. However, please note that the repository is still under heavy development.
- By default, only a limited number of libraries are installed to support the basic cache functionalities. When you need to use additional features, the related libraries will be **automatically installed**.
- Make sure that the Python version is **3.8.1 or higher**, check: `python --version`
- If you encounter issues installing a library due to a low pip version, run: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.

### pip install

```bash
pip install gptcache
```

### dev install

```bash
# clone gpt cache repo
git clone https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache.git
cd GPTCache

# install the repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

### example usage

These examples will help you understand how to use exact and similar matching in caching. 

And before running the example, **make sure** the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set by executing `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`. 

If it is not already set, it can be set by using `export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` on Unix/Linux/MacOS system or `set OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` on Windows system. 

> It's important to note that this method is only effective temporarily, so if you want a permanent effect, you'll need to modify the environment variable configuration file. For instance, on a Mac, you can modify the file located at `/etc/profile`.

#### OpenAI API original usage

```python
import os
import time

import openai


def response_text(openai_resp):
    return openai_resp['choices'][0]['message']['content']


question = 'whatâ€˜s chatgpt'

# OpenAI API original usage
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
start_time = time.time()
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
  messages=[
    {
        'role': 'user',
        'content': question
    }
  ],
)
print(f'Question: {question}')
print("Time consuming: {:.2f}s".format(time.time() - start_time))
print(f'Answer: {response_text(response)}\n')

```

#### OpenAI API + GPT Cache, exact match cache

> If you ask ChatGPT the exact same two questions, the answer to the second question will be obtained from the cache without requesting ChatGPT again.

```python
import time


def response_text(openai_resp):
    return openai_resp['choices'][0]['message']['content']

print("Cache loading.....")

# To use GPT cache, that's all you need
# -------------------------------------------------
from gptcache.core import cache
from gptcache.adapter import openai

cache.init()
cache.set_openai_key()
# -------------------------------------------------

question = "what's github"
for _ in range(2):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
      messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': question
        }
      ],
    )
    print(f'Question: {question}')
    print("Time consuming: {:.2f}s".format(time.time() - start_time))
    print(f'Answer: {response_text(response)}\n')
```

#### OpenAI API + GPT Cache, similar search cache

> After obtaining an answer from ChatGPT in response to several similar questions, the answers to subsequent questions can be retrieved from the cache without the need to request ChatGPT again.

```python
import time


def response_text(openai_resp):
    return openai_resp['choices'][0]['message']['content']

from gptcache.core import cache
from gptcache.adapter import openai
from gptcache.embedding import Onnx
from gptcache.cache.factory import get_ss_data_manager
from gptcache.similarity_evaluation.simple import SearchDistanceEvaluation

print("Cache loading.....")

onnx = Onnx()
data_manager = get_ss_data_manager("sqlite", "faiss", dimension=onnx.dimension)
cache.init(
    embedding_func=onnx.to_embeddings,
    data_manager=data_manager,
    similarity_evaluation=SearchDistanceEvaluation(),
    )
cache.set_openai_key()

questions = [
    "what's github",
    "can you explain what GitHub is",
    "can you tell me more about GitHub"
    "what is the purpose of GitHub"
]

for question in questions:
    start_time = time.time()
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages=[
            {
                'role': 'user',
                'content': question
            }
        ],
    )
    print(f'Question: {question}')
    print("Time consuming: {:.2f}s".format(time.time() - start_time))
    print(f'Answer: {response_text(response)}\n')
```

</details>

To use GPTCache exclusively, only the following lines of code are required, and there is no need to modify any existing code.

```python
from gptcache.core import cache
from gptcache.adapter import openai

cache.init()
cache.set_openai_key()
```

- **Cache Manager**:
The **Cache Manager** is responsible for controlling the operation of both the **Cache Storage** and **Vector Store**.
  - **Eviction Policy**:
  Currently, GPTCache makes decisions about evictions based solely on the number of lines. This approach can result in inaccurate resource evaluation and may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. We are actively investigating and developing a more sophisticated strategy.
    - [x] LRU eviction policy
    - [x] FIFO eviction policy
    - [ ] More complicated eviction policies
- **Similarity Evaluator**: 
This module collects data from both the **Cache Storage** and **Vector Store**, and uses various strategies to determine the similarity between the input request and the requests from the **Vector Store**. Based on this similarity, it determines whether a request matches the cache. GPTCache provides a standardized interface for integrating various strategies, along with a collection of implementations to use. The following similarity definitions are currently supported or will be supported in the future:
  - [x] The distance we obtain from the **Vector Store**.
  - [x] A model-based similarity determined using the albert_duplicate model from [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/).
  - [x] Exact matches between the input request and the requests obtained from the **Vector Store**.
  - [x] Distance represented by applying linalg.norm from numpy to the embeddings.
  - [ ] BM25 and other similarity measurements
  - [ ] Support other models
 
  
  **Note**:Not all combinations of different modules may be compatible with each other. For instance, if we disable the **Embedding Extractor**, the **Vector Store** may not function as intended. We are currently working on implementing a combination sanity check for **GPTCache**.
